            Burnout has always been highest in healthcare and especially so in hospitals. Since covid it has reached an alarming <b>63% of physicians</b> in the States. The estimated annual financial loss there is $260M in burnout related turnover alone, and almost <b>$5B</b> when included with other consequences of burnout such as reduced quality of care and increase in medical error.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A significant contributor to burnout in hospitals is cumbersome processes that are a result of the complexity of the system. Yet we believe this is not intrinsic and can be improved. We <b>streamline hospital processes</b> for the clinicians so that they can focus on the professional part of their work, what they came here to focus on - <b>caring for patients</b>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We are currently designing an application that focuses on improving <b>cross-department consultation</b> processes. By adding a layer of accessibility and transparency from the moment a request is made until it is fulfilled, we remove uncertainty and reduce the effort required from clinicians.

In the past few weeks I’ve been working on a new project I’m kinda excited about - a service that generates customized backend servers. But wait. What about ParentScheduler? I guess I should start from the beginning. Or more accurately the end. The end of ParentScheduler. At least for now.

When I wrote my last post I had a burst of energy. I truly felt like picking myself up and continue on fighting. But the very next day I woke up and it was gone. I was so tired of pushing. So tired of fighting. Tired of trying to get people interested in the app. And I couldn’t bring myself to work on it any longer. But it’s hard to admit defeat. I was stuck in indecision for a bit until I was talking to a friend, telling her about how stuck I was. She was trying to help with ideas about marketing and in my attempt to make her understand I blurted out - yes, I could do this and that but... **I just don’t want to work on this any more!**

And there it was. As soon as those words left my mouth I realized it was true. I did _not_ want to work on this any more. And though my pride and natural stubbornness egged me to continue, my heart was no longer in it.

I meant what I said. I still believe there is something in that idea. I still think the world deserves, and surely will soon get, better family management tools. But it will most likely not be me who does that. I might still go back to it at some point in the future, if the stars align and I find a good marketing person who wants to tackle this with me, but for now? I need to put it aside.

Then came the natural question - **so what’s next?** Should I start looking for a job? I didn’t really feel like it, and I decided to close ParentScheduler before I was out of runway. Should I take on some freelance work? Didn’t really feel like that either. Well, if you’ve been following the blog you know what I did. I’ve let myself not know, practicing the tao. There was lockdown, I barely had time for myself, and I figured for now I can just be. I told my partner I’m "taking a vacation" but that felt wrong. A thought that never occurred to me materialized in my mind - **work does not define me. I do not live to work.** I still am even when I do not work. It is not _who I am_ nor what drives me to get up every morning. Before work, before anything, **I just am.**

It is not often that we get a chance in life to just be. And I had that chance now. So I grabbed it.

I spent about a week just being. Not trying to figure out what I will do next, not worrying about what will happen next. Not feeling like if I am not doing "anything" then I am failing at something. Not feeling like if I am not working then I have no worth. I think it is a terrible lie society tells us - that we need to be productive to earn the right to be. But I just am. We are.

Then school was about to start and while I really enjoyed the book I was reading I felt the need for some technical challenge. Not to feel worthy or to have it define me. But because I truly wanted something cool to play with. And I thought to myself - in this journey with ParentScheduler I have met quite a few entrepreneurs who want to build a product, who might have front end or mobile skill, but don’t want to have to deal with a backend. The current available solutions are very limiting and vendor locked.

For me, as someone who has built many types of systems and many backends it takes half a day to get up and running with a full model view controller in a hosting service. So why shouldn’t it be as simple for other people?

So I’ve decided to take this on, at first as a technical curiosity. Can I? Can I build a server that builds servers? Can I write code that generates a customized, fully functioning backend? Very quickly the answer I came to was yes. Yes I can not only do it but I am also **excited** about doing it. I’m working on it with a passion I haven’t felt in a while. But wait, there’s more. It’s not only that I found that I can and want to do it. I also found **people are interested in it**. That _unlike with ParentScheduler where everything felt so hard, this feels easy_. People are curious. They want to hear more. They want to tell me what they have, what they need and what they have tried. People get as excited as I am by this idea.

This is a small kindling. I don’t know if it will turn into a bonfire. But I am back to enjoying the road, and isn’t it the most important part?

I’ve always loved books. I’ve been reading fiction from a young age, mostly sci-fi and fantasy, and to this day I prefer reading to other forms of consuming information. That’s why, when I decided to set out on this voyage of building a startup, I naturally started reading about it. This is my current list of books I’ve read and my key takeaways, I’d love to hear your own thoughts on them! Also feel free to connect on goodreads! I love to talk about books!
